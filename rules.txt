Description:
============
Swap and slide is a card sorting game, sort the suits from
left to right: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades. Sort the ranks from
top to bottom: Ace, King, Queen and Jack.

The aim is to sort the cards in as few moves as possible.

Game Play:
==========
Cards are to be sorted by using two types of moves:
    -Swap - pick a card and any other card, they swap places.
    -Slide - pick one of the cards you just swapped and one of its 
neighbours (above, below or beside, but not diagonally touching)

Turns consist of one swap then one slide. Always in the same order. 

Scoring:

Performing either a swap or slide move increases the score by 0.5.
